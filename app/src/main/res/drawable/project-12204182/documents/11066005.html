    Updated by Brian on 5/27 from meeting on 5/10<br><ul>
<li>Increase tablet functionality (They want site to work better on tablet), usage is &gt;50% on tablet now. This is driving their decision to reskin</li>
<li>Migration would be somewhat expensive. Not necessarily concerned, but recognize migration would be like 30% of a budget if need to migrate to new platform</li>
</ul><br>Current Site:<br><ul>
<li>WP</li>
<li>Custom e-commerce on top</li>
<li>Catalog not kept in DB, bit more static on the consumer side</li>
</ul><br>Existing Integrations (may have got name wrong or spelled incorrectly)<br><ul>
<li>Shift Station - Inventory Management</li>
<li>UPS</li>
<li>No tax engine - use nexus in 3 states</li>
<li>Autoship - subscriptions service</li>
<li>Authorize.Net</li>
<li>Meta Locator - store locator</li>
<li>Fat Merchant - Merchant Account (may use it or want to use it, requires update to 5.6, possibly for compliance reasons, not functional reasons)</li>
</ul><br>They have 2 sites - would ideally want both in Magento if we go that route<br><ul>
<li>Wholesale ($4m sales) - logged in to see pricing, discrete per user pricing, only able to see products on your price list</li>
<li>Retail ($1.5m sales) - All customers have same pricing </li>
</ul><br>Magento (if we went that way)<br><ul>
<li>Would they best to use CE or EE?</li>
<li>Costly plugins?</li>
<li>What produce/commerce implementation would they use (I assume we were discussing checkout modules)?</li>
<li>Concerned about </li>
</ul><br>Server Updates<br><ul>
<li>I think this is what Jason said "their current site is statically compiled against certain packages", which might make it difficult to just update the instance to different server settings/ versions</li>
<li>use standard EC2 Amazon setup</li>
<li>Need to update openSSL from K-&gt;S</li>
<li>Goal to be PCI compliant</li>
</ul>
