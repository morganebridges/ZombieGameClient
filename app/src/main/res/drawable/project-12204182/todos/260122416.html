        <p><b>Morgan Bridges</b> on June 30, 2016:</p>

        <div class="content">
          Found issues. Needed a SOAP module installed for php 5.6 so that we can connect to various external SOAP apis (stamps.com etc).Â <br><br>Another breaking issue: We need to make a decision about how to handle these files in the /bovedashared directory. They are all making calls to the production database, which is going to break every call. We could make a local copy of the entire directory for our dev site or alternatively make the one on the server point to the DEV database (the latter would affect the rest of the sites that Jason has on this server). <br><br>Thoughts?
